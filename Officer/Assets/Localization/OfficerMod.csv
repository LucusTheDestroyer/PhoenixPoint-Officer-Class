From squad-level decision making to morale management, our Officers will optimise the performance of the operatives under their command.

In recognition of their additional responsibilities, we have recommissioned the Personal Defence Weapon programme: our Officers will be armed with a firearm that is compact, manoeuvrable, and easy to use.",,,,,,,,
