# Phoenix Point Officer Class Mod ([Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3250097289))

This mod introduces a new Soldier class and accompanying weapon to the Phoenix Project's roster: The Officer Class. Designed as a tactical support unit, its abilities provide interesting squad-oriented utility rather than improvements to personal firepower. Despite its supporting role, a new PDW has been added to accompany the Officer and help it defend itself.

This mod should be compatible with all other mods on the workshop, **including Terror from the Void**. For non-steam users who'd like to use this mod, check out the [releases page](https://github.com/LucusTheDestroyer/PhoenixPoint-Officer-Class/releases) for the Phoenix Point Mod Enabler (PPME) version.

### Class Features:
- Only one Officer can be deployed on a mission, so be careful when choosing who you promote.
- The Officer can only be selected as a secondary class; Leadership positions are earned!
- Since the Officer is only available as a second class, it features an additional ability at level 4.
- Mutoids can't train as Officers nor select Officer abilities.

While the class draws some parallels to its Long War 2 equivalent, the original motivation behind it was to re-balance some of the game's existing support abilities without removing them completely. I give more information on this, alongside answering some other potential questions about the mod in the [FAQ on the Workshop page.](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3250097289/4326349337176496186/)

### Acknowledgements
First and foremost, a very special thank you to my co-creator, LillyRike, who designed and drew the majority of the new icons used in this mod (excluding those used for Onslaught and Deadeye). All rights to these icons belong to her only. If you'd like to support her work or commission her for your own projects, [check out her info page here.](https://lillyrike.carrd.co/)

The PDW added by this mod is an unused asset buried in the original game's files, thus all rights to the weapon's model and textures belong to Snapshot Games.

Lastly, many thanks to several other members of the Phoenix Rising team for their input on design, implementation and polish.
